# PCjs Machines

[PCjs](https://www.pcjs.org) is the home of [PCx86](/machines/pcx86/), the original IBM PC emulator that runs in your web browser.

It is one of several JavaScript Machines in this project that span a variety of devices:

  - [6502-based Microcomputers](/machines/osi/c1p/)
  - [8080-based Microcomputers](/machines/pcx80/)
  - [Arcade Machines](/machines/arcade/invaders/)
  - [DEC Minicomputers and Terminals](/machines/dec/)
  - [IBM PC and PC Compatibles](/machines/pcx86/)
  - [Texas Instruments Programmable Calculators](/machines/ti/)
  - [LED Simulations](/machines/led/)

along with a small collection of software used for archival/demonstration purposes only.
