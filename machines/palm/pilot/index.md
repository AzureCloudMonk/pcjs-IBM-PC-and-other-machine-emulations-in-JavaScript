NOTE: As you've probably already guessed, the simulation below isn't that of an original Pilot handheld.  The [Space Invaders](/machines/arcade/invaders/) screen is just a placeholder until I've finished porting my old 68K emulator.  Although, coincidentally, Scott Ludwig did create a version of [Space Invaders for the Pilot](https://web.archive.org/web/19970113081712/http://massena.com/darrin/pilot/invaders.htm) back in 1996, which may reappear here at some point.
